# Scien-T

Scien-T was made for the completion of our college thesis. It is a web-based gamified learning system to help students be motivated and pique their interest in chemistry.
It is a website to learn and play while tracking your progress or collecting cosmetics just for fun.
Learn through Trivias, Mixing Table, and an interactive Periodic Table or play and learn with games like Mix Dash, Test Battle and Electron Configuration.

The MERN stack was the tech stack that was used. For the games included it was made by purely ReactJS and CSS Animations.
