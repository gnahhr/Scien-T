			"Vinegar is a solution of acetic acid in water and contains between 5% to 20% ethanoic acid by volume. The pungent smell and the sour taste is characteristic of the acetic acid present in it.",
			"An undiluted solution of acetic acid is commonly referred to as glacial acetic acid. It forms crystals which appear like ice at temperatures below 16.6oC. It has a wide range of applications as a polar, protic solvent. In the field of analytical chemistry, glacial acetic acid is widely used in order to estimate substances that are weakly alkaline.",

			"Hydrochloric acid is an inorganic chemical. It is a strong corrosive acid with a chemical formula HCl. It is also known as hydrogen chloride or muriatic acid.",
			"When hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water HCl is formed. It is a simple diatomic molecule. The hydrogen and chlorine atom are connected with a single covalent bond. The bond between them is polar as the chlorine atom is more electronegative when compared with the hydrogen atom.",
			"It is strongly acidic. It is colourless and viscous. It is corrosive and has a distinctively pungent smell. It is widely used as a laboratory reagent and in industry. It is used in the processing of leather, the production of gelatin. The physical properties such as density, melting point, PH, and boiling point depends on the molarity or concentration of HCl."

			"Sulfuric acid is also known as Mattling acid or Oil of vitriol. It has a strong acidic nature and is corrosive. At higher concentrations, it acts as an oxidizing agent and dehydrating agent. It is a syrupy liquid which is odourless and has no colour. It is water-soluble and releases heat when dissolved in water. It is widely used in the manufacturing of fertilizers. It is also used in chemical synthesis and wastewater processes."
