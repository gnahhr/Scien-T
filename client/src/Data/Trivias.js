        description: `"Under standard conditions nickel is a silvery-white metal that is fairly hard, but malleable. Nickel is one of the few elements that is magnetic at room temperature. Nickel can be polished to a shine and resists corrosion. It is also a decent conductor of electricity and heat. Nickel is one of the primary elements of the Earth's core which is thought to be made mostly of nickel and iron. It is also found in the Earth's crust where it is about the twenty-second most abundant element. Nickel was first isolated and discovered by Swedish chemist Axel Cronstedt in 1751. Nickel gets its name from the German word "kupfernickel" which means "devil's copper."

        used: "The majority of nickel that is mined today is used to make nickel steels and alloys. Nickel steels, such as stainless steel, are strong and corrosion resistant. Nickel is often combined with iron and other metals to make strong magnets. Other applications for nickel include batteries, coins, guitar strings, and armor plate. Many nickel based batteries are rechargeable like the NiCad (nickel cadmium) battery and the NiMH (nickel-metal hydride) battery."

It is also very ductile allowing it to be easily bent and stretched into a wire. Copper is found in the Earth's crust. Because copper is slow to react, it is often found in its pure form. Copper has been known about since ancient times as far back as 10,000 years ago. The name comes from the word "Cuprum", which is the Latin name for the island of Cyprus."`,
        used: "Copper is found in the Earth's crust. Because copper is slow to react, it is often found in its pure form. This was how many ancient cultures were able to take advantage of the metal. Today, most copper is extracted from minerals such as copper sulfides or copper carbonates. The world-wide demand for copper has increased dramatically in recent years. This has caused an increase in the price of copper. Fortunately, copper is 100% recyclable and large percentage of copper each year comes from recycling. The number one producer of mined copper is Chile who produces around 33% of the world's mined copper."
